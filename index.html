<h1> Closing Gender Gap in STEM </h1>


<h2> Why Is This Important? </h2>

<p> One of the major education challenges facing the Unite States and many other countries in the world is the growing gender gap in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).Although women make up 55 percent of the total population who go to colleges and graduate schools, they are much less represented in STEM majors. Increasing the diversity of STEM enriches creativity in collaboration and broadens the scope of innovation. Getting more female students into STEM could also help them realize their full potential, and further reduce the gender wage gap in the future. Implications from study of gender gap issue in sTEM can help parents, schools, and policy makers find effective methods to increase female students' awareness of and interest in STEM.</p>
