<h1> Closing Gender Gap in STEM </h1>


<h2> Why Is This Important? </h2>

<p> One of the major education challenges facing the Unite States and many other countries in the world is the growing gender gap in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).Although women make up 55 percent of the total population who go to colleges and graduate schools, they are much less represented in STEM majors. Increasing the diversity of STEM enriches creativity in collaboration and broadens the scope of innovation. Getting more female students into STEM could also help them realize their full potential, and further reduce the gender wage gap in the future. Implications from study of gender gap issue in sTEM can help parents, schools, and policy makers find effective methods to increase female students' awareness of and interest in STEM.</p>  

<h2> Data </h2>

<p> * 2015 census data from the [Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml). </p>

<p> * 3,147,005 individuals with information including household characteristics, demographics, education, and social and economic status. </p>

<p> * 119,765 women with declared undergrad or graduate degree.</p>

<h2> Interesting Findings </h2>

<p> 1. Cultural influence: Female students with Asian parents are more likely to major in STEM. </p>

<p> 2. Social network and role model effects: Female students are more like to major STEM if their fathers majored STEM. </p>

<p> 3. Enviroment factors: Female students having access to computers and internet at home are more likely to major STEM. </p>

<p> 4. Regional education policy: Female students living in the eastern states are more likely to major in STEM compared to the states in the middle and west. </p>
